          <p>ZEE HORSE BALLET serves as a virtual accessory to <a href="https://catieburrill.com/zee-horse" class="text-orange-400 hover:text-teal-400">ZEE HORSE</a> puppet, a large scale fiber piece I created for a screen printing class during the quarantine.  I used the fabrics that I screen printed in that class to construct the horse.  Using the same pattern from the screen prints, I illustrated my digital horses.  This was not my original idea but developed through my time being isolated at home.  The first couple of weeks were very challenging for me and I felt super stir crazy and trapped, similar to the dynamic movements of the little horses trapped within ZEE HORSE or on the ZEE HORSE BALLET effect.  Being in quarantine, I started thinking, what do I actually want to make?  What do I really want to come alive and look at everyday?  I always came back to this dream I have.  I want to create a roadside attraction, where I will entertain the masses with miniature horses and have little races, and little rodeos.  I want to call it ZEE WEE RANCH.  My final projects (ZEE HORSE and ZEE HORSE BALLET) are an ode to this idea, to the utopic place I wish to call home.  As difficult as this has been, I am thankful for this time away from school to remind me who I am and what I want to create rather than what my assignments are. </p>
